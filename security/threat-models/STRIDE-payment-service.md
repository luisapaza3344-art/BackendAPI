| Token theft and replay | Short-lived JWT with PQ signatures + nonce | Dilithium-5 prevents quantum signature forgery |

### Tampering with Data
| Threat | Mitigation | Post-Quantum Enhancement |
|--------|-----------|-------------------------|

| Broken access control | Zero-trust architecture | Continuous PQ authentication |
| Container escape | PodSecurityPolicy + seccomp | Cryptographically enforced isolation |

## Quantum-Specific Threats

### Harvest Now, Decrypt Later (HNDL)
**Threat**: Adversary captures encrypted payment data today to decrypt with future quantum computers.

**Mitigation**:
- Kyber-1024 KEM for all payment encryption (256-bit quantum security)
- Hybrid mode: X25519+Kyber for defense-in-depth
- Forward secrecy: New keys for each session

### Grover's Algorithm (Symmetric Key Search)
**Threat**: Quantum computer reduces symmetric key strength (AES-256 â†’ AES-128 equivalent).

**Mitigation**:
- AES-256 in GCM mode (provides 128-bit quantum security)
- SHA3-512 for hashing (256-bit quantum security)
- Bcrypt with cost factor 12+ for password hashing

### Shor's Algorithm (RSA/ECC Breaking)
**Threat**: Quantum computer breaks RSA-2048 and ECC-256 in polynomial time.

**Mitigation**:
- **Complete elimination of RSA/ECC** in production
- Dilithium-5 replaces ECDSA/RSA signatures
- Kyber-1024 replaces ECDH key exchange
- Hybrid mode for transition period

## Risk Assessment
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Severity | Mitigation Status |
|------|------------|--------|----------|-------------------|
| Quantum computer breaks RSA | Low (2030+) | Critical | **HIGH** | âœ… Mitigated (PQ crypto deployed) |
| Traditional attacker | Medium | High | **MEDIUM** | âœ… Mitigated (defense-in-depth) |
