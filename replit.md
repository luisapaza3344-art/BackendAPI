# Financial-Grade Security Payment Gateway

## Overview

This is an enterprise-level payment processing platform designed to meet the highest security standards in the financial industry. The system implements FIPS 140-3 Level 3 compliance, PCI-DSS Level 1 certification, and quantum-resistant cryptography. The platform supports multiple payment providers (Stripe, PayPal, Coinbase Commerce) while maintaining zero-knowledge proof verification for enhanced privacy and security.

The architecture follows a microservices approach with specialized services for payment processing, security auditing, and authentication. Each component is built with financial-grade security requirements, including Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration, immutable audit trails anchored to blockchain systems, and post-quantum cryptographic algorithms.
