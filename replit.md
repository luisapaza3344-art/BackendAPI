# Government-Grade Post-Quantum Payment Platform

## Overview

This project is a government-level secure payment processing platform designed to exceed enterprise standards. It incorporates NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography, FIPS 140-3 Level 3 compliance, and PCI-DSS Level 1 certification to protect against future quantum computing attacks through a hybrid classical+quantum cryptographic approach. The platform utilizes a microservices architecture with shared post-quantum cryptography libraries, GitOps for infrastructure management, policy-as-code for security, and automated compliance. Its core purpose is to provide highly secure, quantum-resistant payment processing with blockchain-anchored audit trails and a zero-trust architecture.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Core Architecture
The platform follows a platform-first microservices approach. Shared libraries for post-quantum cryptography, protobuf/OpenAPI service definitions, OpenTelemetry observability, and blockchain-anchored compliance auditing are central to the design. Infrastructure is managed via GitOps (Kubernetes, Argo CD, Helm) with strong supply-chain security and policy-as-code enforcement (OPA/Rego) for PCI-DSS and NIST 800-53 compliance. CI/CD pipelines include automated FIPS compliance gates.

### UI/UX Decisions
The platform includes an Ultra Category Management and Ultra Collection System with AI-powered rules, enterprise analytics, visual branding, SEO optimization, and smart automation. It provides real-time endpoints for CRUD operations and advanced filtering.

### Technical Implementations
- **Programming Languages**: Rust (for core payment and security services, memory safety), Go (for API Gateway, other services), Python (for PQC libraries).
- **Cryptography**: Kyber-1024 KEM, Dilithium-5 Digital Signatures, SPHINCS+ Hash-based Signatures, hybrid classical+quantum modes (X25519+Kyber, Ed25519+Dilithium).

- **Audit & Compliance**: Blockchain-anchored audit trails (IPFS + Bitcoin network), immutable audit logs, metadata sanitization, QLDB for transaction records.
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, Redis caching for performance.
- **Deployment**: Immutable deployments with pinned image digests, NetworkPolicy and PodSecurityPolicy enforcement.

- **Quantum Resistance**: Integrating NIST-approved Post-Quantum Cryptography throughout.
- **Defense-in-Depth**: Multiple layers of security, from cryptography to policy-as-code and audit trails.
- **Automated Compliance**: CI/CD gates and policy engines enforce security standards.
- **Comprehensive Testing Framework**: End-to-end testing, security testing (FIPS, PQC, ZKP), performance testing, and webhook security testing.

## Recent Changes

### September 30, 2025 - Coinbase Payment Endpoint Fix
- **Issue Resolved**: Fixed 422 Unprocessable Entity error on Coinbase payment endpoint
- **Root Cause**: Frontend sent simple JSON structure but backend expected complex enterprise structure
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Added `SimpleCoinbaseRequest` for frontend compatibility
  - Created database query method to fetch cart details from `temp_payments` table
  - Handler now accepts simple frontend data, enriches with cart details, and converts to enterprise structure
  - Maintained all enterprise features (fraud detection, PCI-DSS compliance, quantum cryptography)
- **Architecture**: Dual-mode handler supporting both simple frontend calls and advanced enterprise usage
- **Security**: Parameterized queries, proper error handling (400/404), all fraud/PCI controls remain active
