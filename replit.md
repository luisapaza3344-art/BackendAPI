# Government-Grade Post-Quantum Payment Platform

## Overview

This is a **government-level secure payment processing platform** that **exceeds enterprise standards** with NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography, FIPS 140-3 Level 3 compliance, and PCI-DSS Level 1 certification. The platform implements quantum-resistant cryptography to protect against future quantum computer attacks, with defense-in-depth through hybrid classical+quantum algorithms.

The architecture follows a **platform-first microservices approach** with shared post-quantum cryptography libraries, GitOps-driven infrastructure, policy-as-code security enforcement, and government-grade compliance automation. Every component is designed to meet or exceed government security standards with quantum resistance, blockchain-anchored audit trails, and zero-trust architecture.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
