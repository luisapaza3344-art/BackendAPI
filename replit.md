# Financial-Grade Security Payment Gateway

## Overview

This is an enterprise-level payment processing platform designed to meet the highest security standards in the financial industry. The system implements FIPS 140-3 Level 3 compliance, PCI-DSS Level 1 certification, and quantum-resistant cryptography. The platform supports multiple payment providers (Stripe, PayPal, Coinbase Commerce) while maintaining zero-knowledge proof verification for enhanced privacy and security.

The architecture follows a microservices approach with specialized services for payment processing, security auditing, and authentication. Each component is built with financial-grade security requirements, including Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration, immutable audit trails anchored to blockchain systems, and post-quantum cryptographic algorithms.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Core Services
- **Payment Gateway Service**: Built in Rust for memory safety and formal verification capabilities. Handles all payment processing operations with cryptographic attestations for each transaction.
- **Security Service**: Rust-based audit trail service that creates immutable logs using IPFS and Bitcoin blockchain anchoring. Provides real-time integrity verification endpoints.
- **API Gateway**: Go-based service implementing COSE-JWS authentication with PKI-based request signing.
- **Authentication Service**: Supports Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), WebAuthn, and passkey authentication.

### Database Layer
- **Primary Database**: Neon PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Audit Storage**: Quantum Ledger Database (QLDB) for immutable transaction records
- **Distributed Storage**: IPFS for decentralized audit trail storage

### Security Architecture
- **Hardware Security Modules**: AWS CloudHSM for FIPS 140-3 Level 3 certified key management
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Implementation of zk-SNARKs (Groth16 and PLONK) for payment verification without exposing sensitive data
- **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography**: NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography finalists for future-proofing against quantum computing threats
- **Public Verifiability**: Open-source verification CLI allowing external parties to validate system integrity

### Compliance Framework
- **PCI-DSS Level 1**: Tokenization and secure card data handling
- **GDPR/HIPAA**: Data governance with EU Digital Identity Wallet integration
- **Multi-jurisdictional**: Support for CCPA, LGPD, and PIPL compliance requirements

### Infrastructure Design
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: No implicit trust boundaries with continuous verification
- **Autonomous Operations**: Cryptographic operations run without human intervention to prevent insider threats
- **Multi-Region Deployment**: AWS infrastructure with experimental Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) between availability zones
