## Analysis

### FIPS 140-3 Claims
- **Status**: Claims present but requires validation
- **Risk**: High - FIPS 140-3 Level 3 requires hardware security modules and extensive certification
- **Recommendation**: Verify actual FIPS validation certificates and test reports

### PCI-DSS Level 1 Claims
- **Status**: Claims present with implementation evidence
- **Evidence**: Data masking, secure storage, access controls implemented
- **Risk**: Medium - Implementation exists but requires formal assessment
- **Recommendation**: Conduct formal PCI-DSS assessment by qualified security assessor

### NIST Standards Claims
- **Status**: Claims present with algorithmic implementation
- **Evidence**: Post-quantum cryptography algorithms implemented
- **Risk**: Low - Standard algorithmic implementations
- **Recommendation**: Verify algorithm implementations match NIST specifications

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Remove or qualify FIPS 140-3 Level 3 claims until formal validation completed
   - Document PCI-DSS implementation controls for assessment preparation
   - Verify NIST algorithm implementations against published standards

2. **Long-term Actions**:
   - Pursue formal FIPS 140-3 validation if hardware security modules are available
   - Schedule formal PCI-DSS assessment by qualified assessor
   - Implement compliance monitoring and continuous validation processes

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Replace absolute compliance claims with "designed for compliance with" language
   - Add disclaimers about certification status and ongoing validation requirements
   - Maintain detailed compliance control documentation

## Conclusion

The codebase contains extensive compliance-oriented implementations but includes several absolute compliance claims that require formal validation. The technical implementation demonstrates strong security controls consistent with compliance frameworks, but formal certification status should be verified and documented appropriately.
